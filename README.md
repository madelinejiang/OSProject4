<h1 style="color: #5e9ca0;">Operating Systems Project 4</h1>
<h2>Contributors: Joel Yin, Madeline Jiang</h2>
<p>This is our final project for Operating Systems.</p>
<p>The purpose of this project was to simulate loading, interrupt handling, and swapping pages between memory and disk. The particular focus of this project was to simulate virtual memory manager handling a demand paging scheme.</p>
<p>This project demonstrated the transfer of data between MAR, AC and MBR per commands from the Information register(IR). Swapping pages was responsive page faults. Furthermore swap space was managed via threading in order to be parallel to the CPU execution.</p>
<p>Found in this repository are also the project requirements 3 and 4 from CS 5348 Operating Systems. Taught by Dr. I-Ling Yen.&nbsp;Documentation of each .c file as well as opcodes (simulating assembly language), interrupt vector codes, and console commands found in project requirements of Project 3 and Project 4 pdfs. Further description of each function and inputs found in simos.h.</p>
