change fopen state to r in load_process_to_swap in loader (was erasing prog.1)
overhauled insert_swapQ so it wouldn't give segmentation faults
altered load_process_to_swap. Ensured return type (this was giving errors)

Current status: no segfaults after submitting to swapQ. 
question should the swapQ have 5 entries
